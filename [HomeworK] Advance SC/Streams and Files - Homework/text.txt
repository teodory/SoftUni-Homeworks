Regular expressions, or regex, is a symbolic language that describe how to identify 
a sequence of integers (or, more practically, characters) as matching a required set. 
Compared to mathematics regular expressions are pathetically tiny. There's only a few 
symbols to learn, and they have exact specific meanings. This makes them easy to learn, 
given that you actually put in the time to learn to read and write them.

Effectively a regular expression is the algebra equation to a programming language's 
word problem. With them you can describe things that would take mountains of code if 
you were to write it by hand. This is why they exist, but being symbolic languages most 
people simply hate them because most people are never taught how to learn a symbolic language.
